        Busy weeknights has me making 30 minutes or less recipes. They are easier and turn out to be, oh. so. good!This

                    <h4><strong>Step 1</strong></h4>
                    <p>The first step is to cook up your veggies. I used a combination of red and yellow peppers, snow
                        peas,
                        broccoli, carrots, and mushrooms. I also added some baby corn and water chestnuts into the mix
                        for
                        variety. While the veggies are cooking, I make a simple garlic sauce. The sauce gets poured over
                        the
                        veggies then is simmered until thickened. You can enjoy your veggie stir fry as-is, or over
                        rice.</p>

                    <h4><strong>Step 2</strong></h4>
                    <p>Sauté: In a wok or large skillet add 1 Tablespoon olive oil over medium high heat. Add bell
                        pepper, peas,
                        carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, baby corn, and water chestnuts. Sauté 2-3 minutes until veggies
                        are almost
                        tender.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><strong>Step 3</strong></h4>
                    <p>Whisk: In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, garlic, brown sugar, sesame oil, chicken broth,
                        and
                        cornstarch.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4></h4><strong>Step 4</strong></h4>
                    <p>Mix: Pour over veggies and cook until the sauce has thickened.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4><strong>Step 5</strong></h4>
                    <p>Garnish: add chopped green onions and sesame seeds if desired.</p>
