    <h1 class="pizza-title">Best homemade pizza recipe</h1>
    <p class="pizza-desc">Pizza is a crowd-pleasing choice for busy weeknights and fun weekend dinners alike. But you
        don't have to rely on
        restaurants or takeout for top-notch pizza. Read on for tips on how to make your own pizza at home. We'll walk
        you through how to make pizza crust, how to top a pizza, pizza baking temperature, and how long to bake pizza.
        Plus, we'll share some of our favorite homemade pizza recipes to try.</p>

            <h2>Lets Start With The Crust</h2>
            <p>let's start with the base, the crispy crust that holds it all together. With the crust, you can go a few
                ways:
                You
                can make homemade pizza with store-bought dough; use pre-baked crusts (such as Boboli) or even English
                muffins
                and pita bread for personal pizzas; or make your own pizza dough.</p>

            <h3>Pizza Sauces</h3>
            <p>Now for the sauce. There are loads of delicious pre-made marinara sauces for pizza sauce. We have oodles
                of
                homemade pizza sauce recipes, too. Beyond red pizza sauces, don't forget pesto sauces, white sauces, or
                even
                a
                simple olive oil and garlic sauce. They will expand your pizza potential by almost infinite proportions.
            </p>

            <h4>Pizza Toppings</h4>
            <p>There's almost no limit to the toppings you can pile on a pizza. Tomato sauce and pepperoni you know. But
                apples
                and walnuts? For sure. Fresh figs and prosciutto? Of course! Sweet corn and peas? Well, in Europe and
                Japan,
                corn and peas are common pizza toppings. Bottom line, pizza is open to an infinite amount of creativity
                where
                toppings are concerned.</p>

            <h4 class="instructions-heading">Cooking On Stone</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3><strong>Heat the oven</strong></h3>
                    <p>Generally, the hotter the oven, the better the pizza will be. The best oven temperature for pizza
                        is
                        between 450 and 500 degrees F (250 to 260 degrees C). Pizza ovens cook at temperatures between
                        800
                        and 900 degrees F. You can't get that hot in your home oven, but the higher you can go, the
                        better.

                        Place a pizza stone ($39; Amazon) on a lower oven rack. Preheat the oven between 450 and 500
                        degrees
                        F (250 to 260 degrees C) â€” the stone needs heat up while the oven heats. Large, thick-crusted
                        pizzas
                        might need an oven temperature closer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) so the crust can cook
                        completely before the toppings burn.

                        Tip: For a crunchy crust, preheat a baking sheet or cast iron skillet in the bottom of the oven.
                        Once you load the pizza, toss ice cubes into the hot pan to create a burst of steam.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3><strong> Form the pizza dough and place it on a peel dusted with a little flour or
                        cornmeal.</strong></h3>
                    <p>If you like, lightly brush the crust with olive oil. This helps create a golden brown, crispy
                        crust
                        rather than a dry, dusty outer crust. See how to make and form your pizza dough.

                        Okay, the oven is hot, and the pizza's all topped and ready to roll. You need to grab your pizza
                        peel ($22; Amazon), the large shovel-like tool that easily moves pizza from counter to stone
                        without
                        catastrophe. Slide your pizza onto the peel. It's time for the oven.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3><strong>Slip the pizza onto the hot pizza stone.</strong></h3>
                    <p>Tip: Jiggle the peel to make sure the pizza isn't sticking. You want it to slide off the peel
                        easily.
                        If it's stuck, gently lift the sticky dough and dust with a wee bit more flour or cornmeal.

                        Place the tip of the peel on the edge of the stone at the back of the oven. With one swift
                        motion,
                        jerk the peel back out from under the pizza. If the pizza slides freely on the peel, it should
                        land
                        perfectly in the middle of the pizza stone. If the pizza sticks to the peel, your toppings will
                        slide off the pizza onto the stone, and the kids will hear you say those words you're not really
                        supposed to use in front of them.

                        Close the oven door, and let the pizza bake.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3><strong>After 5 minutes of baking, check the pizza.</strong></h3>
                    <p>If some spots are browning faster than others, turn the pizza; slip the peel underneath it like a
                        giant spatula. Rotate the pizza on the peel and return it to the baking stone using the same
                        swift
                        motion described above.

                        If you like, remove the pizza from the oven halfway during baking to brush more oil on the
                        crust.
                        This added oil will help darken the crust and make it even tastier. For a little garlic flavor,
                        infuse the oil with minced garlic.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h3><strong>The pizza is done when the cheese is melted to a medium-to-dark brown.</strong></h3>
                    <p>Color means flavor. Carefully remove the pizza with the peel and let it cool slightly. If you
                        want,
                        top it with additional fresh toppings. Slice with a pizza wheel ($15; Amazon) or chef's knife,
                        and
                        serve to your adoring crowd.
